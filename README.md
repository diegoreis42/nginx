# Nginx kata

[Nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) is one of the most popular web servers since 2004. Besides, it can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. To practice different ways of configuration I make this repo, and of course I'm using docker so you can easily try by yourself too!
